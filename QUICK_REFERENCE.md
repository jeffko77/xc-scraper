## Common Workflows

4. Status changes to ðŸš« (excluded)
5. Click **Include** to re-enable

**Why exclude?**

2. Enter athlete name
3. Select gender filter
4. View all performances

2. Select gender
3. Select team (optional)
4. Set result limit
5. Download CSV if needed

## Database Management

### First Time Setup

```bash
# 1. Create .env file
echo "DB_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/xc_results" > .env

# 2. Run migration (if upgrading from old version)
python migrate_add_exclusion.py
```

### Backup Database

```bash
# PostgreSQL backup
pg_dump -U user xc_results > backup.sql

# Restore
psql -U user xc_results < backup.sql
```

## Team Name Matching

The app automatically matches team names to schools in `reference/missouri_schools.csv`.

**Examples:**
- "Parkway West" â†’ Class 5, District 1
- "St. Louis University" â†’ Matched to "S.L.U.H." in Class 5
- "Rockhurst" â†’ Class 5, District 1

**Note:** Team names must match exactly or be close to CSV entries. If a team isn't matched, it won't appear in Class/District rankings.

## Troubleshooting

### Meet not showing in rankings?
- Check if it's excluded in **Meet History**
- Verify teams are in `missouri_schools.csv`

### Athlete not found?
- Try partial name search (e.g., "Smith" instead of "John Smith")
- Check gender filter is correct
- Verify meet was imported successfully

### Database connection error?
- Check `.env` file exists
- Verify `DB_URL` is correct
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running

### Import fails?
- Verify URL is from MileSplit
- Try changing `/formatted/` to `/raw`
- Enable verbose mode to see detailed logs
